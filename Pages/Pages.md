# Pages folder

Contains Razor pages and supporting files. Each Razor page is a pair of files:

1. A .cshtml file that has HTML markup with C# code using Razor syntax.
2. A .cshtml.cs file that has C# code that handles page events.

Supporting files have names that begin with an underscore. For example, the _Layout.cshtml file configures UI elements common to all pages. _Layout.cshtml sets up the navigation menu at the top of the page and the copyright notice at the bottom of the page.
